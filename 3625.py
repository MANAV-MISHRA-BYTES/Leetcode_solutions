'''
3625. Count Number of Trapezoid II

You are given a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of the ith point on the Cartesian plane.

Return the number of unique trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from points.

A trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

 

Example 1:

Input: points = [[-3,2],[3,0],[2,3],[3,2],[2,-3]]

Output: 2

Explanation:



There are two distinct ways to pick four points that form a trapezoid:

The points [-3,2], [2,3], [3,2], [2,-3] form one trapezoid.
The points [2,3], [3,2], [3,0], [2,-3] form another trapezoid.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]

Output: 1

Explanation:



There is only one trapezoid which can be formed.

 

Constraints:

4 <= points.length <= 500
–1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000
All points are pairwise distinct.
